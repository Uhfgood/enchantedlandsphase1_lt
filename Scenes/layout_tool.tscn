description = "Hubert sneaks into Wizard U and examines the \"hall of fame\" paintings and notices one is missing.
After realizing what's missing, he leaves the school.

Hubert examines the outside of the school, noting all the windows are boarded up and the door is padlocked.
After examining further he notices a hole in the bottom of one of the side walls, with a little mouse standing, wearing wizard’s garb with a puzzled look on his face.
Hubert asks the mouse if he’s a a good wizard, to which the mouse replies he’s just a tourist but was getting good with his wand, until he lost it.
Hubert then offers to help him find his wand if he helps Hubert in return.

HIt 1 to search the grounds.
Hit 2 to ask the mouse to examine himself.
hit 3 to ask the mouse to retrace his steps.

Hubert searches the grounds, but doesn't seem to find anything. 
When he gets back just before telling him the bad news he spots it behind the mouse's ear.
He then tells the mouse to check behind his ear, and realizes he did that when he needed both paws for the training manual.

Hit 1 to continue.

Hubert asks the mouse to examine his own person.
The mouse starts checking pockets, his hat, and finally his paw hit's behind his ear.
After pulling it out the mouse recalls putting it there in order to read the training manual with both paws.

Hit 1 to continue.

Hubert asks the little mouse wizard to retrace his steps and think of where he last saw it. 
The mouse claims he was trying to levitate a piece of cheese from the icebox, and needed to look in the training manual.
While recalling it, he remembered it was in his ear, to which Hubert promptly pulls it out and then hands it back to him.

Hit 1 to continue.

The mouse asks Hubert what he needs, and Hubert tells him he needs to get inside the school even though it’s all closed up.
The mouse replies in the affirmative and pulls out the training manual.

The mouse says sure, and pulls up a spell to shrink someone, and shrinks Hubert down to his size with his newly found wand.
Hubert then enters the wall into the mouses dorm room.  Then passes through the mouses room door.

Once inside the mouse reverses the spell and Hubert grows back to normal size.
Hubert makes his way to the trophy room, and notices a display case that had previously housed a quicksilver scepter, was now empty, with no signs of tampering.

Next Hubert goes to the Wizard University “Hall of Fame” he noticed one of the portraits is missing.
Hubert realized it was the portrait of Maximilian Spell who had attempted to take over other realms before and was banished.
Hubert looks at the other portraits and notices the other wizards have a shocked or surprised look on their faces.

When Hubert came back to the mouse’s dorm room, he shrunk Hubert again, and when Hubert was outside, restored him back to his normal size.
