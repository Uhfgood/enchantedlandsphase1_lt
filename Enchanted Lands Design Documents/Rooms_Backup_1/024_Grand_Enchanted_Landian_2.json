    "description": "At the Grand Enchanted Landian Max tells Zanzibar that he knows he's been stealing and that this is his last show.\nZanzibar performs his whole show, and then Corvus (his pet crow) steals money from the audience as usual.\nJust then, Max yells that he took all his money.\nThe crowd looks angrily toward Zanzibar and starts chasing him.\nMax gets word that the Omni-Gate is ready for testing, so he leaves for the Castle.\nZanzibar distracts the crowd with a few cheap tricks and escapes out the back with his loot.\n\nHit 1 if you wish to go to Lapsewood 2.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
