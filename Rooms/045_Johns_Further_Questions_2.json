    "description": "John was curious about what he stepped into when he entered the portal.  Hubert tells him, they're indeed trains, but they also fly, because of a special magical mineral nicknamed \"Quicksilver\" that permeates the Lands, and allows modern conveniences, including flight.  Most Enchanted Landians are not magical, but they use magic every day due to the quicksilver content in everything.  He also explains that when a tourist first visits, they always step througha portal to a flying train if one is running.  While not strictly necessary, it sets up the vacation and introduces Enchanted Lands in a magical way.  Hubert also states that these days, there aren't many trains running, because of the problems as of late.\n\nHit 1 if you are interested in the schools.\nHit 2 if you want to know about the Dwarves and the Gnomes.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
