After having seen his friends act contrary to their nature, he reasons that they must be under some sort of enchantment, and thus decides to find a way to break it.\n\nAs Chester is flying home he spots yet another flying train which is somewhat unusual given the fact that there hasn't been much tourist activity as-of-late.\n\nHit 1 to continue.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
