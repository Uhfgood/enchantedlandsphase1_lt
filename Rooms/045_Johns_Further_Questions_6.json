    "description": "John was curious about what appears to be at train.  Hubert tells him they are but they fly magical mineral \"Quicksilver\" that permeates the Lands, and allows modern conveniences.  Most Enchanted Landians aren't born with magic, but use it every day due to the quicksilver in everything.  He explains that when a tourist first visits, they always step into a flying train if one is running.  While not strictly necessary, it sets up the vacation in a magical way.  Hubert also states that these days, there aren't many trains running, because of the problems as of late.\n\nHit 1 if you are interested in the schools.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
