    "description": "Hubert tells John he was in a flying train due to the \"Quicksilver\" that makes inanimate objects levitate.  When a tourist first visits, they always step into a flying train if one is running.  While not strictly necessary, it sets up the vacation in a magical way.  Hubert also states that these days, there aren't many trains running.\n\nHit 1 to continue.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
